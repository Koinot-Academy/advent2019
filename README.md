# Advent Of Code 2019

We, Guillaume ([@GuillaumeMnt](https://github.com/GuillaumeMnt)) and Thomas ([@elkoiko](https://github.com/elkoiko)), both wanted to learn the Go language. We decided to practice with it while having fun solving Advent Of Code's puzzles.

Each one of us has its own branch, go check it out !

You can discover all the puzzles on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
